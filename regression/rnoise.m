function noise=rnoise(v,s_to_n,irange,flag)
% RNOISE ... create a random noise signal with a given s/n
%
% noise= rnoise(v,s_to_n,irange,flag)
% noise= rnoise(v,s_to_n,irange)
% noise= rnoise(v,s_to_n)
% noise= rnoise(v)
%
% returns a vector of zero mean pseudo random noise
% of the same dimensions as v.
%
% v= input signal vector used to determine the dimensions
%    of the noise vector and the rms signal level.
% s_to_n= desired signal to noise level (rms). Rnoise measures
%         rms power of v and sets the standard deviation of the 
%         noise as: noise_power = signal_power/s_to_n
%      ******* default = 2 *******
% irange= vector of indicies pointing to the range of v over
%         which the signal is to be measured. For example, '1:50'
%         would use the first 50 samples, or near(t,.72,.99) would
%         use the time zone from .72 to .99 (assuming t is the time
%         coordinate for v)
%      ********* default= 1:length(v) ********
% flag= 1 ... noise is normally distributed
%       0 ... noise is uniformly distributed
%      ******** default = 1 *******
